Welcome to Clean Sailing repository! 

Clean Sailing is a simple sandbox prototype where you control a boat and your main task is to keep Paradise Island's coasts as clean from rubbish as possible.

The main purpose of this small project is to play around with water behaviour and all it involves (water material design, floatin objects, boat controller, etc), as well as a bunch of different Unity's specific techniques and tools such as Post Processing, Lightweight Render Pipeline, Shader Graph and VFX/Particle systems, among others.

Throughout the development stages of the project, I will try to follow to the extent possible a structured and well organized workflow, starting with a brief and really basic Game Design Document (included in this repository as well) defining the different aspects of the game (art style, game mechanics, npc and controllable characters/objects, game modes...).
