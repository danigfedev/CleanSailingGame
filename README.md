Welcome to Clean Sailing repository! 

Clean Sailing is a simple sandbox prototype where you control a boat and your main task is to keep Paradise Island's coasts as clean from rubbish as possible.

The main purpose of this small project is to play around with water behaviour and all it involves (water material design, floating objects, boat controller, etc), as well as a bunch of different Unity's specific techniques and tools such as Post Processing, Lightweight Render Pipeline, Shader Graph and VFX/Particle systems, among others.
